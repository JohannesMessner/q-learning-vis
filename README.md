# q-learning-vis
Interactive visualisation of an actor learning his environment through reinforcement learning.

This interactive visualisation allows the used to place a stylised robot into an unknown grid world that can be populated with obstacles and rewards.
The robot can then explore his environment and learn how to find his way to a reward-cell using Q-learning.

The value of the Q-function at every cell (=state) can be visualized through colour-coding, so that the user can see which cells seem promising to the robot.
